Audiograph is a plugin that makes it simple to share clips of podcasts (your own or your other favorites) by embedding them into your Wordpress blog.


== Description ==
The Audiograph plugin makes it easy to embed your Audiograph clips in your Wordpress blog as simply as pasting in a link. Audiograph clips are unique as they include both the transcript and audio of your podcast. This means readers enjoying your post can choose how they prefer to choose your content and you can maximize your engagement.

Audiograph relies on the [Audiograph podcast service](https://audiograph.io) to load clips and podcast transcripts. Because data is loaded from Audiograph, you may want to check out their terms of service and privacy policy. 

You can find the [terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRVJTx_MPWKD9RbKfw9XdpCU-PCMc0yB1zUjd2Xyh0SXnKcCx8WIDjy_0CTiRrSNK6LOiIVR3cXpZ50/pub) and [privacy policy](https://audiograph.io/privacy) at these links.
